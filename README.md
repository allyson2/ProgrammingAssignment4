# Week 4 Final project - Getting and Cleaning Data

This is the final project of Getting and Cleaning Data course from the Data Science Specialization on Coursera.

The run_analysis.R script performs the load of the files, process them and outputs a new final file according to the instructions.
The name of the variables weren't modified.

The R script performs these tasks:

1. Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.

2. Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement. 

3. Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set

4. Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names. 

5. From the data set in step 4, creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.
